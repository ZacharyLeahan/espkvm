 * A finished recording, from transport stream to MP4, without re-encoding.
 *
 * A .ts is what survives a pulled card while it is being written; an MP4 is
 * what plays in a browser, in a phone's player and inside a Telegram chat. So a
 * dashcam clip is recorded as .ts and turned into an MP4 once it is complete.
 * The index goes at the front of the file, so it starts playing before it has
 * all arrived, and the moments that made the clip become chapters.
 *
 * Reads the .ts twice - once for the sample tables, once for the samples - so
 * memory holds compact metadata rather than the recording. Plain C over callbacks,
 * so it is tested on a host. Only reads what ts_mux writes: one H.264 access unit
 * per PES on PID 0x100, plus optional AAC-LC ADTS frames on PID 0x101. Audio
 * and video share a 90 kHz timestamp origin. Start offsets and capture gaps
 * are retained; unsupported or changing AAC formats fail conversion.
